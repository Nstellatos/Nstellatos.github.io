After learning the Ruby programming language for 2 months it was now time for me to make my first project. I had to create a CLI using an API. My first question was “where do I start?”. The first thing I had to figure out was what API I wanted to use for my project. After spending way too much time(3 days to be exact) figuring out which API I wanted to use, I finally committed to using The COVID Tracking Project API. Through this API I was able to access all US States current COVID values. I mean I taking this course in the middle of a pandemic...
How my Program runs:
My program retrieves States current COVID-19 totals from from the COVID Tracking Project 
API. It represents all US States full name and their abbreviation. The user is able to type in a State abbreviation followed by ENTER to see the States name, abbreviation, positive COVID case total, recovered COVID case total and the total COVID deaths. The user will then see that they have the option to check out another states current values or exit the program. If the user decides to exit the program they will see a goodbye message. 
If the user does not know the state abbreviation, they are able to type in SEARCH followed by ENTER and they will be prompted to enter in the full state name. This will output the same information it would if they just typed in the abbreviation. If the user enters in an invalid response, they will get an error message asking them to enter in a valid response.
My takeaway:
I felt many different emotions while creating my project. I felt rage, confusion, excitement and RELIEF. Through this project I was able to make new coding friends that helped me along the way. Interacting with my classmates allowed me to understand my functionalities better and it was great to pick their brains when I ran into issues.

Cheers to finishing Module 1 ! :)
