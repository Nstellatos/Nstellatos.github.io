At the end of my senior year of High School, the questions “what do you want to do in life?” and “where do you see yourself in 5 years?” were asked a lot. Most people would have the traditional response but when I was asked these questions I always replied, “I want to be a software engineer”. Mind you, I really had no idea what that meant but it always felt like the right answer for me. 
I started my journey browsing free coding websites and I took great interest in it. I would practice coding but I was never very consistent. I would spend hours looking at boot camps I can attend to take my desire to code more seriously.  I was certain that this is what I was going to do for the rest of my life. 
Unfortunately, life gets in the way sometimes. I had now entered the working field and going from job to job became my new normal. I have always been the type of person to just go with the flow and I had the mindset of if it is meant to be it will be. Then, the COVID-19 outbreak occurred and my life suddenly came to a stop. I had no job but I had all the time in the world to self reflect. I started asking myself the same questions that I was constantly asked during my senior year of High School. 
Years and years later, my answer to “what do you want to do in life?” was still “I want to be a software engineer”. I am attending Flatiron School for my future self. I am pursuing this dream of mine and making it a reality. In 5 years from now I will be able to say “I am a software engineer”.
